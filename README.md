# redmine_docker_compose_sidekiq

This repo is meant to showcase proposed changes to https://github.com/docker-library/redmine/ as well as provide an example on how to use the proposed changes in a docker compose context.

The compose stack runs the same image as two services:
- one running the ruby on rails redmine application
- the other one running the sidekiq background worker

Additionally there are services for
- postgres as a database
- valkey as a redis-like kv-store

**This setup assumes you are running a reverse proxy for http/https and is not part of main compose stack**. There is `proxy/docker-compose.yml` however, that shows how that is intended to work.

## Credentials and secrets

To configure credentials for the database and key-value store, this repo utilizes docker secrets.

Place the desired passwords in text files with the corresponding names in `./secrets`, e.g. via:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 64 >> ./secrets/DB_PASSWORD
openssl rand -hex 64 >> ./secrets/REDIS_PASSWORD
```
The values are mapped and used in the respective services accordingly.

## run the stack

- create the external network
    ```bash
    docker network create web
    ```
- run the stack
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
- watch the logs
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f --tail=100
    ```
- eventually, you should see output like
    ```bash

    ```
## running the reverse proxy

Again, some assumptions here.

You need to obtain SSL certifiactes, for instance from LetsEncrypt. Place the certificate and key in `proxy/certs` and/or change the volumes in the docker compose in `proxy/docker-compose.yml`.

The certificate file names as well as domain names are set to the examplary value of `mydomain.com`, change them accordingly in the `proxy/conf.d/snippets/standard_ssl.conf` files to fit your domain / file names you set in the volume mount.

The redmine instance is assumed to be run under the subdomain `redmine.`, you can change that in `proxy/conf.d/redmine.conf`

- obtain and place SSL Certificates
- create the Diffieâ€“Hellman params
    ```bash
    openssl dhparam -out ./proxy/dhparam.pem 4096
    ```
- run the stack
    ```bash
    cd proxy
    docker compose up -d
    ```
- watch the logs
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f --tail=100
    ```

## the two docker files
The Dockerfile used by default is `Dockerfile.debian.sidekiq`, there is also `Dockerfile.debian.sidekiq.oidc` which addionally integrates aplugin for OIDC/OAuth, see https://github.com/kontron/redmine_oauth/
